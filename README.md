MLP3115A2_altimeter
===================

Files for command line usage of the altimeter on the beaglebone. Original files from http://www.freescale.com/webapp/sps/site/prod_summary.jsp?code=MPL3115A2&amp;nodeId=01126990366B26&amp;fpsp=1&amp;tab=Documentation_Tab

TODO: system.h keeps calling for headers that don't exist in this system. I think the basics of these files are good, and useful, but will need to be modified for Angstrom so they stop depending on whatever bizarre context Freescale intended them to be used under.
